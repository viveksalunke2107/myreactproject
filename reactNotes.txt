-react project work on components 

-components :-it is partial part of react app.
             -it can be any part of react app, which we can reuse multiple time .

-in react root components name is app             

*in react there are two types of components
1-function components: when our main focus is on UI Design 
2-Class components: when we have to write complex logic for UI.

Note: when we create component its file name must start with capital letter.


*How to display component output

Q.What is JSX:
-it stand for javascript and XML ,
-it makes react code eassy, and allows us to write html code in react.
-in jsx we need to wrap multiple element inside one parent element.

*props(property):
-it is parameter or function parameter which is use to pass data inside component.
-it return data in object formate.
-in function component we access props data by writting props.propsname
-in class component we access props data by writting this.props.propsname

*Functions and Events:
*hover Events
*onClick 

Task1: create one function component with name MyDetailComp in which pass fname,mname,lname,mobile,gender,address as props and display it .
Task2: create one Class component with name  in which pass fname,mname,lname,mobile,gender,address as props and display it .

*State : 
-it is use to handle essesntial data in class component.
-it return data in object formate.
-we write State in class component constructor.
-we can access state data in class component by writting this.state.property 

-after react version 16 we can use state in function component by using hooks (useState Hook); 

*setState() method : it allows us to manupulate state propertuy values.

*destructuring : creating constant variable to store data in it.

*destructuring of state
*destructuring of props 

Task1: crete cone class component with name myCounter having state with on property having name count with value 0, you have create three button one will increment , second will decrement and thired will reset value.

-to perform component interaction they must have parent child relation in between component.

*passing state data as props to child component
*passing function as props to child component 

*PureComponent :
-it is to prevent unnecessary re-rendering of class component.
-by performing shalow comparision it prevent unnecessary re-rendering of class component.
-to achive this we have to extends class component with PureComponent.

*React.memo():
-it is to prevent unnecessary re-rendering of function component.
-by performing shalow comparision it prevent unnecessary re-rendering of function component.
-to achive this we need to pass function component name as parameter inside React.memo(componentName) method
