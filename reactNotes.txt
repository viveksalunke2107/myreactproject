React :
-it is javascript library.
-it is use to create rich User Interface.
-it is use to create single page application(SPA).
-it is not framework.
-react developed and maintain by facebook
-latest version of react is react-19

*Framework: collection of multiuple library

*Software Prequisit 
-nodejs 
  node -v // it display node version
-npm 
 npm -v 
-vs code

*Technology Prequisit
-html
-css
-javascript(basic to advanced, ES-5 and ES6, oops);

*how to create react project 
1.by using npx : no need to install configuration file 
  step1:npx create-react-app appname 
  step2:cd appname
  step3:npm start 

2.by using npm : need to install configuration file.
  step1:npm install -g create-react-app
  step2:create-react-app appname
  step3:cd appname
  step4:npm start 

3.by using Vite : it create react project with minimum file.  

*How to start react project 
npm start // it will start react project in development mode and display output on browser with localhost:3000 port number

Folder structure
node_module folder: all dependecy will install in this folder.
package.json file : all install dependecy entry will fouind here.
package-lock.json file : it will contain detail description of all dependecy
gitignore: avoid file to upload on git.
publick: it contain only static file.
src folder : actual development 

-react project work on components 

-components :-it is partial part of react app.
             -it can be any part of react app, which we can reuse multiple time .

-in react root components name is app             

*in react there are two types of components
1-function components: when our main focus is on UI Design 
2-Class components: when we have to write complex logic for UI.

Note: when we create component its file name must start with capital letter.


*How to display component output 
-import component and write its name as tag where you want.

Q.What is JSX:
-it stand for javascript and XML ,
-it makes react code eassy, and allows us to write html code in react.
-in jsx we need to wrap multiple element inside one parent element.

*props(property):
-it is parameter or function parameter which is use to pass data inside component.
-it return data in object formate.
-in function component we access props data by writting props.propsname
-in class component we access props data by writting this.props.propsname

*Functions and Events:
*hover Events
*onClick 

Task1: create one function component with name MyDetailComp in which pass fname,mname,lname,mobile,gender,address as props and display it .
Task2: create one Class component with name  in which pass fname,mname,lname,mobile,gender,address as props and display it .

*State : 
-it is use to handle essesntial data in class component.
-it return data in object formate.
-we write State in class component constructor.
-we can access state data in class component by writting this.state.property 

-after react version 16 we can use state in function component by using hooks (useState Hook); 

*setState() method : it allows us to manupulate state propertuy values.

*destructuring : creating constant variable to store data in it.

*destructuring of state
*destructuring of props 

Task1: crete cone class component with name myCounter having state with on property having name count with value 0, you have create three button one will increment , second will decrement and thired will reset value.

*React Fragment: 
-it is an alternative option for jsx.
-it is use to remove unwanted element from react project.

*component Interaction:
-when we have to pass data from parent component to child component.
-to perform component interaction they must have parent child relation in between component.

*passing state data as props to child component
*passing function as props to child component 

*PureComponent :
-it is to prevent unnecessary re-rendering of class component.
-by performing shalow comparision it prevent unnecessary re-rendering of class component.
-to achive this we have to extends class component with PureComponent.

*React.memo():
-it is to prevent unnecessary re-rendering of function component.
-by performing shalow comparision it prevent unnecessary re-rendering of function component.
-to achive this we need to pass function component name as parameter inside React.memo(componentName) method


*We saw one vs code extention to create class and fuinction component

rce : it generate class component
rconst : it generate constructor with super method and state
rfce : generayte normal function component
rafce : generate arrow function component

*How to use Bootstrap in react project 
step1: install Bootstrap 
      npm install bootstrap 
step2: go to index.js file and import its path

*we saw counter Task.

*Conditional redering : display component output on the basis of condition.
-there are four ways to display output conditionally 
1. if else: if the condition is true if block will render otherwise else block.
2. element as variable: in this we store data inside on variable and return that variable.
3. use of ternary operator: it is an shorthand syntax of if else statment 
               syntax:  (condition) ? truepart : false;
4. use of short circuit(&&): it will display component output only if condition is true.
                            -it is use for null checking.

*How to use css in React component:
-in react we use className property instead of class 

1.internal css: inside an element we use style property with values
2.external css: in this we create a seperate css file and import it inside component
3.Module css : in react we use module css when we have to write css property for pertucular component. while creating module css file we have to use filename.module.css 

*Virtual DOM:
-in react instead of manipulating browser DOM directly react create virtual in its memory,where it does all necessary changes before browser DOM. virtual DOM changes what need to be changes. thats why react is fater than angular.

Task: create new Class component having name EmpDetails containing stat with emp property holding array of object data for 7 employee id,name,post,salary,gender,city , display employee data inside table by using map method.
================================================================================

*HOC(Higher Order component):
-it is use to to share same(Comman) bussines logic with multiple component.
-in this we use function component and share data from it 
-in this function component we pass another component as parameter.

*Error Boundary :
-it is react component which is use to handler errors in component three which occures at the time of compenent rendering 
-in this we use two class component lifecycle method 
1.getDerivedStateFromError,2.ComponentDidCatch 
1.getDerivedStateFromError: it is static method which execute automatically when error occure in component 
2.ComponentDidCatch: it is use to display error log(error information);

*How to display array of object data into card formate

*Class Component Lifecycle method 
-class component lifecycle comes with four phases
1.Mounting Phase: when component initialized.
  -constructor: when class object initialized it will execute 
  -getDerivedStateFromProps : it is use to assign props data to an state.it is static method.
  -render : it is use to display component output 
  -ComponentDidMount: it execute once after component render.

2.Update Pase: when DOM manipulation is done 
   -shouldComponentUpdate: it decide there component get updated or not, it return boolean result , if it return true value then component will update otherwise not
   -getSnapshotBeforeUpdate: it return state or props value before update of it.
   -render: it is use to display component output 
   -ComponentDidUpdate: it return state or props value after update of it.

3.Unmounting Phase: when component deleted or remove 
  -componentWillunMount: it will remove all external connection with component just before deleting of component
4.ErrorPhase : when error get generated 
  -getDerivedStateFromError: when error occure in component it execute automatically.
  -ComponentDidCatch: it will display error log or information.






*Routing In React :
-navigation of component and display it output(view);
-to perform routing in react we use react-router-dom library.
npm install react-router-dom 

src folder 
   layout folder 
       -LoginComp
       -NavComp 
       -MainDashboardComp
       -PageNotFoundComp 
   RoutingFolder 
      -mainRouting.js  file 
   Hookes folder 
      -ReactHooksComp 
      -UseStateComp
      -UseEffectComp 

-HOC 
-ErrorBoundary 
-Form Validation 
-Class component LifeCycle Method 
-Hooks
